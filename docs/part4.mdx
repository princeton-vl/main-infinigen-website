##### Generate videos on a desktop workstation

```
python -m tools.manage_datagen_jobs --output_folder outputs/myjob --num_scenes 50 --pipeline_configs local_64GB monocular_video --cleanup big_files
```

In most of the above commands we assume you are on a slurm cluster. If you want to run locally, replace `pvl` with `desktop` or `desktop_small` (for 256GB or 128GB ram workstations), or make your own tools/pipeline_config file and configure compute as you see fit. If you want something other than stereo/video, replace `stereo`/`stereo_video` with `monocular` or `monocular_flow` or some other option from `tools/pipeline_configs`. Note that the pipeline config can only affect what jobs are run (ie how many cameras, how many timesteps), not what those jobs produce. IE, if you want particular passes to be output, you will need to specify that with a `--config` option not a `--pipeline_config`

We use wandb to log stats. If you dont want to deal with this, add `--wandb_mode disabled` to any of the above commands. If you are in PVL, send your username to Alex Raistrick to be added to our wandb group.
