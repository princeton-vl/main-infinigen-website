## Instructions

In this tutorial, we will show you how to generate a single image with Infinigen with depth annotations:

<AssetPreview image_urls={["hello_world/Image.png", "hello_world/Depth.png"]} />

This tutorial does not require a GPU, and assumes all optional compilation steps were skipped.

:::caution Memory Requirements

These commands consume in excess of 15GB of memory.

:::

:::caution Reproducibility

You may obtain a rearranged scene due to platform-specific library versions.

:::

:::caution System

The current example does not yet work for Mac OS.

:::

**These issues are expected to be resolved soon.**

To generate this image, run:

```bash
cd worldgen
mkdir outputs
../blender/blender --background -noaudio --python generate.py -- --seed 3be70e09 --task coarse -g desert simple --output_folder outputs/helloworld/coarse
../blender/blender --background -noaudio --python generate.py -- --seed 3be70e09 --task populate fine_terrain -g desert simple --input_folder outputs/helloworld/coarse --output_folder outputs/helloworld/fine
../blender/blender --background -noaudio --python generate.py -- --seed 3be70e09 --task render -g desert simple --input_folder outputs/helloworld/fine --output_folder output/helloworld/frames
../blender/blender --background -noaudio --python generate.py -- --seed 3be70e09 --task render -g desert simple --input_folder outputs/helloworld/fine --output_folder output/helloworld/frames -p render.render_image_func=@flat/render_image
```

The full pipeline should take 20 minutes to 1 hour.

The resulting images and dense annotations will be located in: `outputs/helloworld`

You can run ../blender/blender outputs/helloworld/coarse/scene.blend to view the intermediate "relatively low poly" file, or ../blender/blender outputs/helloworld/fine/scene.blend to view the full file that is rendered. Both of these will have many meshes hidden in the editor by default, to help performance.

### Ready to remove the guardrails? Try the following:

Swap 'desert' for any of config/scene_types to get different biome (or write your own config!). You can also add in the name of any file in configs.
Change the seed to any number to get different scenes
Remove 'simple' to generate more detailed (EXPENSIVE) scenes
Read and customize generate.py to understand how infinigen works under the hood.
Append `-p compose_scene.grass_chance=1.0` to the first command to force grass (or any of generate.py's 'run_stage' asset names) to appear in the scene. You can modify the kwargs `@gin.configurable()` python function in the entire repo via this mechanism.

:::caution experimenting with Infinigen

As you experiment with the system using your own settings and random seeds, it will crash with some frequency (due to the wide variance of resources required across scenes, and for various other reasons).

Different configurations may result in large memory spikes, or very long runtimes. In these cases, it often makes sense to simply pick a different random seed.

:::info github issues

Please check the [Github issues page](https://github.com/princeton-vl/infinigen/issues) for help debugging.

Before posting a new issue, please add `--debug` to generate.py or manage_datagen_jobs for more detailed logs in stdout. Include these logs in your report.
