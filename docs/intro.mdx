# Installation

Our installation instructions have been tested on the following systems:

- Apple Silicon (M1/M2) (≤ MacOS Monterey)
- Ubuntu 22
- Windows WSL

:::caution Known issues

- Apple Silicon (M1/M2) (MacOS Ventura)

:::

For x86 architectures, we also have [Docker intructions](./docker.mdx)

For help with installation, please post to our Github issues page.

## Setup

Clone the infinigen repo:

```
git clone --recursive <TODO>
```

Create a conda environment:

```
conda create --name infinigen python=3.10
conda activate infinigen
```

**(Optional, Ubuntu)** in order to use our OpenGL-based system for producing dense annotations, install the following dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install libglm-dev libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libgles2-mesa-dev zlib1g-dev
```

Alternatively, we support generating ground-truth from Blender's built-in render passes.

Finally, run the install script

```
bash install.sh
```

If you want to run with CUDA, compile on a CUDA machine.

### Troubleshooting

If the above didnt work for you, or you wish to rebuild part of the project, below are instructions for manually compiling the terrain-related C++ code

```
cd /worldgen/terrain/cpp_utils
# on linux including ionic
blender-3.1.2-linux-x64/3.1/python/bin/python3.10 setup_linux.py build_ext --inplace
# or the following on Mac
CC="${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/opt/llvm/bin/clang++" /path/to/Blender.app/Contents/Resources/3.1/python/bin/python3.10 setup_macos.py build_ext --inplace
```
