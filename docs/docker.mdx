# Docker Instructions

We also provide instructions for running our system in a docker container.

## Linux

Install the Docker Engine by following the steps [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

In `/infinigen/`, run

```
cd docker
```

```
bash make_docker.sh
```

Alternatively, to run Infinigen without GPU passthrough in the Docker container, run `bash make_docker.sh --noGPU`

```
docker exec -it infinigen bash
```

```
source setup.sh
```

## Windows

[Install](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support#1-overview) WSL 2 (with WSLg) and Ubuntu. Make sure that you are either on the latest version of Windows 10 or on Windows 11.

In Powershell, run `wsl -l -v` to verify that WSL is using version 2. If not, refer to [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2.) guide on upgrading.

Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and make sure that "Use the WSL 2 based engine ..." is enabled in Settings. Keep the Docker Desktop application running.

In Powershell, run `ubuntu` to enter the Linux subsystem and then run

```
git clone https://github.com/princeton-vl/infinigen.git
```

Make sure that you have a valid [SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) in the Linux subsystem.

Verify that `echo $DISPLAY` returns `:0`. If not, WSLg was not properly installed.

Then,

```
cd docker
```

```
bash make_docker.sh
```

In Docker Desktop, you should see that there is now an active container. Run

```
docker exec -it infinigen bash
```

```
source setup.sh
```

## Apple Silicon (M1/M2)

Infinigen does not support containers for Apple Silicon devices due to issues in Docker's emulation of x86 architecture.
