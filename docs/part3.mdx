## Creating Individual Assets

In ```/infinigen/worldgen/```, run 

```
../blender/blender --background -noaudio --python tools/asset_grid.py -- -f CarnivoreFactory -n 10 -r 1024x1024 -s --gpu
```
This will generate 10 different carnivore assets, each with a .blend file and image render, which can be inspected in ```/worldgen/outputs```.

```-f``` controls the type of asset generated. ```-n``` controls how many different assets are generated. ```-r``` controls the resolution
of the renders. ```-s``` saves the .blend files of the assets. ```--gpu``` enables GPU rendering.
