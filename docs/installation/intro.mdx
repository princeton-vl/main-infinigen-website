# Installation

Installation is tested and working on the following platforms:

- Apple Silicon (M1/M2) (≤ MacOS Monterey)
- Ubuntu 22
- Windows WSL

For x86 architectures, you can also try our [Docker intructions](./docker.mdx). Apple Silicon (M1/M2) with MacOS Ventura may face problems finding required C headers, more coming soon. 

Clone the infinigen repo:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/princeton-vl/infinigen.git
```

Create a conda environment:

```
conda create --name infinigen python=3.10
conda activate infinigen
```

To use our optional OpenGL ground-truth system you must install the following dependencies.

```
sudo apt-get install libglm-dev libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libgles2-mesa-dev zlib1g-dev
```

Use appropriate installation commands for your platform. If you do not have sudo access, ask your administrator, or install them using conda and set your $CPATH (more coming soon). If you do not install them, installation of `process_mesh` will crash, but this is fine so long as you use `blender_gt` not `opengl_gt`.

Finally, run the install script.

```
bash install.sh
```

To use GPU-accelerated terrain, you must run `install.sh` on a machine with a GPU and CUDA installed. To disable all GPU-oriented or advanced features, run `SIMPLE=1 bash install.sh` instead.

Please make a Github Issue for help with any problems. 

## Setup for Windows

Instruction for compiling Infinigen on a Windows system.

### Configuring the WSL Environment

[Install](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support#1-overview) WSL 2 (with WSLg) and Ubuntu. Make sure that you are either on the latest version of Windows 10 or on Windows 11.

In Powershell, run `wsl -l -v` to verify that WSL is using version 2. If not, refer to [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2.) guide on upgrading.

In Powershell, run `ubuntu` to enter the Linux subsystem.

Verify that `echo $DISPLAY` returns `:0`.

If not, WSLg was not properly set up. If you had previous installations of WSL/Ubuntu, try uninstalling and doing a fresh install of both. You may proceed without WSLg, but the OpenGL ground truth will not work. Scene and asset generation will still run normally and we support alternative generation of the ground-truth from Blender's built-in render passes.

:::tip (Optional)
Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html#cuda-support-for-wsl-2) to install CUDA on WSL2. This step can be skipped if not using OpenGL.
:::
Install Anaconda in WSL

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.03-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

```
bash Anaconda3-2023.03-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Clone the Infinigen repo

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/princeton-vl/infinigen.git
```

### Installation

After configuring the WSL environment, create a new Python environment with the necessary dependencies

```
conda create --name infinigen python=3.10
conda activate infinigen
```

:::tip (Optional)
In order to use our OpenGL-based system for the ground-truth, install the following dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install libglm-dev libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libgles2-mesa-dev zlib1g-dev
```

:::

Finally, run the install script in `/infinigen/`

```
bash install.sh
```
