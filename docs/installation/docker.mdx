# Docker Instructions

We also provide instructions for running our system in a docker container.

## Linux

Install the Docker Engine by following the steps [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

In `/infinigen/`, run

```
cd docker
```

```
bash make_docker.sh
```

```
docker exec -it infinigen bash
```

```
source setup.sh
```

:::tip Optional
Alternatively, to run Infinigen without GPU passthrough in the Docker container, run

```
bash make_docker.sh --noGPU
```

instead of `bash make_docker.sh`. This will disable the OpenGL ground truth.

Scene and asset generation will still run normally and we support alternative generation of the ground-truth from Blender's built-in render passes.
:::

Infinigen should now be correctly setup in the container. Use `exit` to exit the container and `docker exec -it infinigen bash` to re-enter the container as needed.

## Windows

Ensure that you have correctly set up and configued the WSL2 environment as decsribed in the [Windows setup instructions](./intro.mdx#setup-for-windows)

Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and make sure that "Use the WSL 2 based engine ..." is enabled in Settings. Keep the Docker Desktop application open while running containers.

Create an [SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) in the Linux subsystem if you do not have one already (use default location when prompted).

Then in `/infinigen/`,

```
cd docker
```

```
bash make_docker.sh
```

:::tip Optional
Alternatively, to run Infinigen without GPU passthrough in the Docker container, run

```
bash make_docker.sh --noGPU
```

instead of `bash make_docker.sh`. This will disable the OpenGL ground truth.

Scene and asset generation will still run normally and we support alternative generation of the ground-truth from Blender's built-in render passes.
:::

In Docker Desktop, you should see that there is now an active container named "infinigen. Run

```
docker exec -it infinigen bash
```

```
source setup.sh
```

Infinigen should now be correctly installed in the container. Use `exit` to exit the container and `docker exec -it infinigen bash` to re-enter the container as needed.

## Apple Silicon (M1/M2)

Infinigen does not support containers for Apple Silicon devices due to issues in Docker's emulation of x86 architecture.
