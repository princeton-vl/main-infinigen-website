# Create your first documentation page

import APITable from "../../src/components/APITable";
import AssetPreview from "../../src/components/AssetPreview";
import PreRendered3D from "../../src/components/PreRendered3D";

## Creating a section with pages (e.g. 'Example Section')

To add a new section, create a folder `docs-documentation/<folder_name>`.

Add the following json. You can replace `label` and `position` with whatever:

```json title="docs-documentation/3dassets_terrain/_category_.json" {2-3}
{
  "label": "Example Section",
  "position": 2,
  "link": {
    "type": "generated-index",
    "description": "Option description. Not sure what for."
  }
}
```

To add new pages to this section, create new markdown pages under `<folder_name>`, identical to this page.

:::tip My tip

These markdown files will be interpreted as `.mdx` meaning they support JSX as well. Not essential, but if you want VSCode to stop yelling at you for "syntax errors", download **[this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx)**.

## Code Blocks

Markdown code blocks are supported with Syntax highlighting. For instance, writing this:

    ```python title="procgen/worldgen/generate.py" {2-3}
    def add_ground_twigs(target):
        use_leaves = uniform() < 0.5
        selection = density.get_placement_distribution(scale=0.15, select_thresh=0.55, normal_thresh=0.7, return_scalar=True)
        ground_twigs.apply(target, selection=selection, use_leaves=use_leaves)
    p.run_stage('ground_twigs', add_ground_twigs, terrain_inview)
    ```

will produce this:

```python title="procgen/worldgen/generate.py" {3-4}
def add_ground_twigs(target):
    use_leaves = uniform() < 0.5
    selection = density.get_placement_distribution(scale=0.15, select_thresh=0.55, normal_thresh=0.7, return_scalar=True)
    ground_twigs.apply(target, selection=selection, use_leaves=use_leaves)
p.run_stage('ground_twigs', add_ground_twigs, terrain_inview)
```

## Showing images

We can include image viewers like this directly in markdown:

<AssetPreview
  image_urls={[
    "random_images_for_testing/17319.png",
    "random_images_for_testing/26958.png",
    "random_images_for_testing/4248.png",
  ]}
/>

This was creating using:

```jsx
<AssetPreview
  image_urls={[
    "random_images_for_testing/17319.png",
    "random_images_for_testing/26958.png",
    "random_images_for_testing/4248.png",
  ]}
/>
```

:::caution You should know

It is assumed that all image paths are relative to https://infinigen.cs.princeton.edu/, and that there exists a `<name>_thumbnail.png` for every `<name>.png`

On ionic, this website root is `/n/fs/pvl-progen/website/www`

:::

:::note Creating thumbnails

To create the low-res thumbnails, run

```bash
find /n/fs/pvl-progen/website/www/<path-to-your-images>/ -name "*.png" \
-exec python /n/fs/pvl-progen/website/create_thumbnail_size.py {} \;
```

:::

Markdown also supports regular images:

![Alt Text](https://infinigen.cs.princeton.edu/random_images_for_testing/20342.png)

using:

```md
![Alt Text](https://infinigen.cs.princeton.edu/random_images_for_testing/20342.png)
```

```mdx-code-block
<APITable name="footer-links">
```

| Name    | Type           | Default     | Description                          |
| ------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `title` | `string`       | `undefined` | Label of the section of these links. |
| `items` | `FooterItem[]` | `[]`        | Links in this section.               |

```mdx-code-block
</APITable>
```

## Showing 3D models

Our 3D models are too hi-res to load online. Instead, we can pre-render video frames and view them like so:

<PreRendered3D folder={"example"} begin={1} end={160} />

This was created using

```jsx
<PreRendered3D folder={"example"} begin={1} end={160} />
```

where the frames are stored locally as

- `static/pre_rendered/example/000001.jpeg`
- ...
- `static/pre_rendered/example/000160.jpeg`

Storing them online led to a crappy user experimence, imo.

:::danger Take care

Don't use too many frames. They stored with the website.
